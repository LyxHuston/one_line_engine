Ever looked at your code and lamented that it was much too long?  That it went on and on, with too many lines, no matter how you tried to compress it?

Well, worry no more!  With this module turn *any* multi-line python file into a single line!

In other programming languages with line separators and that aren't whitespace dependent, this is generally trivial!  But in Python, this is a challenge that requires a lot of effort.

Current functionality:

- collapsing brackets/parenthesis and triple quote strings
- separating comments
- separating statements based on the newline characters
